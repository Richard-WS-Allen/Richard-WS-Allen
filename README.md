-Hi, I’m @Richard-WS-Allen

-I’m interested in continuing my growth as a software engineer. I'm currently working on learning more about the low-latency side of C++ through [Building Low Latency Applications with CPP](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Building-Low-Latency-Applications-with-CPP) and creating similar libraries while reading along with the Packt Publishing book along with unit tests and further code optimizations.
